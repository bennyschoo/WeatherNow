# Assignment 1 - Interactive Web Application

## Student Information

- **Name**: Ben Schoonhoven
- **Student ID**: B00954933
- **Date Created**: January 15th, 2025

## Application Type and Description

The Application Type I have chosen for this assignment is the weather application. 
I chose this because I have the most understanding of how a weather website may work.
Another benefit is that I have experience making a weather webpage from 1170 so it should
be easy as pie! 

## Additional Details
### List Of Features
    - Local storage as been implemented with the favourite cities feature
    - A self implemented version of auto complete has been created for the search
      function as I didn't like how the built in browser auto complete worked
    - The auto complete will automatically search the top result when enter is hit
    - The icon on the favourites button changes depending on if the current city is 
      favourited or not
